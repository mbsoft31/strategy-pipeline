# ✅ Refactoring ACTUALLY Complete (Fixed)

**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ NOW COMPLETE (Files actually moved this time!)

---

## What Happened

### Initial Attempt
The first refactoring attempt **failed silently** - the Move-Item commands didn't work, so all files stayed in the root directory.

### Fix Applied
✅ Used Copy-Item + Remove-Item approach  
✅ All 33 files successfully moved to /docs/ subdirectories  
✅ Root directory is now clean

feat: Stage 1 (Problem Framing) + CLI + robustness improvements

Stage 1 Implementation:
- Add ProblemFramingStage generating ProblemFraming and ConceptModel
- Implement generate_problem_framing in SimpleModelService with naive heuristics
- Register problem-framing stage in PipelineController

CLI Implementation:
- Add interfaces/cli.py with 5 commands (start, run-stage, approve, list, show)
- All commands emit structured JSON for machine parsing
- Support for JSON edits and user notes in approvals
- No external dependencies (uses only stdlib argparse)

Persistence Robustness:
- Add proper dataclass serialization/deserialization for datetimes and enums
- Fix ApprovalStatus enum deserialization (map by value)
- Improve project_exists to not create implicit directories
- Add _deserialize_artifact helper for nested object reconstruction

Controller Enhancements:
- Auto-register default stages (project-setup, problem-framing)
- Route start_project through registered ProjectSetupStage
- Persist extra artifacts from StageResult.extra_data
- Implement basic next-stage availability logic based on approval status

Testing:
- Add comprehensive tests for Stage 1 and controller approval flow
- Test persistence edge cases (list_projects, missing artifacts, datetime serialization)
- Add smoke_test.py for manual end-to-end verification
- Add demo_workflow.py showing automated Stage 0 -> Stage 1 orchestration

Documentation:
- Update README with CLI usage examples and implemented stages
- Add STAGE1_SUMMARY.md with detailed implementation notes
- Clean up unused imports and fix linting warnings

Quality:
- All code Python 3.9+ compatible
- Timezone-aware timestamps throughout
- No external dependencies for core functionality
- Clean separation of concerns maintained
